                    <p>
                        {{ config.site_name }} was created to help pet owners find qualified holistic and
                        integrative veterinarians in their area. We believe that every pet deserves access
                        to compassionate care that considers their complete well-being—physical, emotional,
                        and environmental.

                    <p>
                        Our directory connects you with veterinary professionals who combine the best of
                        conventional medicine with natural healing modalities like acupuncture, herbal medicine,
                        chiropractic care, and nutritional therapy.

                    <h2>What is Holistic Veterinary Medicine?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Holistic veterinary medicine is an approach to animal health care that considers the
                        whole patient—not just symptoms or diseases. Holistic vets look at the complete picture,
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical health and symptoms</li>
                        <li>Diet and nutrition</li>
                        <li>Environment and lifestyle</li>
                        <li>Emotional and behavioral well-being</li>
                        <li>Relationships with owners and other animals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This comprehensive approach often leads to better outcomes, especially for chronic
                        conditions that may not respond well to conventional treatment alone.

                    <h2>Integrative vs. Alternative</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most holistic veterinarians practice "integrative" medicine, meaning they combine
                        conventional veterinary medicine with complementary therapies. This isn't about
                        rejecting modern medicine—it's about using the best tools available for each
                        individual patient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A holistic vet might recommend surgery for a torn ligament while also using
                        acupuncture for pain management and herbal supplements for healing support.
                        The goal is always optimal health and quality of life for your pet.
